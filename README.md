# Auto-Clicker
## Auto-Clicker using python pynput
### ```Pynput``` is needed to use this autoclicker
Check out [this page](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/#description) to learn about ```pynput```
### Some of the important variables you may customize are:
```
delay
button
start_stop_key
exit_key
```
```delay``` is the time in seconds before each click (I dont recommend 0 as the delay)

```button``` can be customized to left click, right click (even middle click)

```start_stop_key``` is the key code that can start\stop the auto clicker

```exit_key``` is the key code that will terminate the program

Currently,
```
delay = 30
button = Button.left
start_stop_key = 's'
exit_key = 'e'
```
# POV : You put 0 delay and were not prepared
